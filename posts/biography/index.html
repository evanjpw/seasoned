at the forefront of software engineering and tech management for over four decades. His
journey is a testament to the evolution of the tech industry itself, from the early days
of personal computing to today&rsquo;s cloud-native, AI-driven landscape.</p><h2 id=early-career-and-foundations>Early Career and Foundations</h2><p>Evan&rsquo;s passion for technology was ignited during his time at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, where he studied physics and computer science. As a founding member of a
student-run organization providing facilities for independent research in computer science,
Evan demonstrated early on his drive to push the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible in tech.</p><p>His professional career began in the mid-1980s at ITRAN Corporation, where he cut his
teeth on vision tool editing software and microcode debugging. This early exposure to
low-level systems programming laid a strong foundation for his future work.</p><h2 id=pioneering-in-desktop-publishing-and-collaboration>Pioneering in Desktop Publishing and Collaboration</h2><p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Evan played a crucial role in the desktop publishing
revolution. At Interleaf, he was instrumental in producing the company&rsquo;s first WYSIWYG
Mac and PC products, reimagining how users interacted with document creation software.
His work at Iris Associates on porting Lotus Notes to Mac further solidified his expertise
in creating collaborative tools that would shape the future of office productivity.</p><h2 id=entrepreneurial-spirit-and-innovation>Entrepreneurial Spirit and Innovation</h2><p>The mid-1990s saw Evan embrace his entrepreneurial side. As a consultant and later as the
founder of CollectM, Inc., he demonstrated his ability to not only architect complex systems
but also to lead and inspire teams. His work on digital rights management systems at CollectM
was particularly prescient, essentially conceptualizing NFTs long before they became a buzzword.</p><h2 id=leadership-in-enterprise-software>Leadership in Enterprise Software</h2><p>As the new millennium dawned, Evan took on increasingly senior roles, including Director of
Software Development at CMGion and Director of Product Management at ProvisionSoft. These
positions allowed him to combine his technical acumen with strategic thinking, shaping product
roadmaps and guiding teams towards ambitious goals.</p><h2 id=mastering-modern-web-and-cloud-technologies>Mastering Modern Web and Cloud Technologies</h2><p>Evan&rsquo;s career has always been characterized by staying ahead of the technology curve.
His work at Google and ITA Software showcased his ability to tackle complex problems in
airline reservation systems, leveraging modern server and web technologies. At Symantec,
he further honed his skills in multi-tier architectures and cross-platform development.</p><h2 id=recent-leadership-and-engineering-excellence>Recent Leadership and Engineering Excellence</h2><p>In recent years, Evan has taken on executive leadership roles, serving as Head of
Engineering at AdeptID and Storeroom Logix. In these positions, he has not only led
the development of cutting-edge products but also transformed entire engineering
organizations. His focus on introducing structure, improving code quality, and aligning
engineering vision with business goals has resulted in successful product launches and
improved team performance.</p><h2 id=a-polyglot-programmer-and-architect>A Polyglot Programmer and Architect</h2><p>Throughout his career, Evan has mastered a wide array of programming languages and
technologies. From C and C++ to Java, Python, Rust, and Kotlin, his polyglot skills
allow him to choose the right tool for each job. This versatility, combined with his
deep understanding of software architecture, enables him to tackle projects of any
scale or complexity.</p><h2 id=commitment-to-security-and-best-practices>Commitment to Security and Best Practices</h2><p>Evan&rsquo;s experience with SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and his work on security enhancements
in various roles underscore his commitment to building not just functional, but secure
and reliable systems. His ability to navigate complex regulatory environments while driving
innovation is a rare and valuable skill.</p><h2 id=looking-to-the-future>Looking to the Future</h2><p>As Evan embarks on his latest venture as a &ldquo;CTO for hire&rdquo; with Seasoned Tech, he brings
with him not just a wealth of technical knowledge, but also the wisdom gained from decades
of leadership. His unique blend of hands-on coding expertise and high-level strategic thinking
positions him perfectly to guide companies through their most challenging tech initiatives.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s developing an MVP for a startup, rescuing a troubled project, or helping an
established company navigate a digital transformation, Evan Williams is the seasoned expert
you want in your corner. His journey through the ever-changing landscape of technology has
equipped him with the skills, knowledge, and insight to tackle the challenges of today and
anticipate the innovations of tomorrow.</p></article></div></div></div></section><div id=footer><div class=container><div class=row><section class="col-3 col-6-narrower col-12-mobilep"><h3>Links to Evan's Stuff</h3><ul class=links><li><a href=https://evanjpw.hashnode.devhttps://evanjpw.hashnode.dev>Evan's development blog</a><li><a href=https://evanjpw.github.io>Evan's GitHub Pages</a><li><a href=https://evanjpw.hashnode.dev/a-career-in-eight-bullets>"A Career In Eight Bullets"</a><li><a href=https://universeodon.com/@evanjpw>Mastodon</a><li><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/users/4717637/evan-williams>StackOverflow</a></ul></section><section class="col-3 col-6-narrower col-12-mobilep"><h3>Site Links</h3><ul class=links><li><a href=https://calendly.com/evanjpw-seasoned/30min>Schedule a Meeting</a><li><a href=/photo-credits>Photo Credits</a></ul></section><section class="col-6 col-12-narrower"><h3>Get In Touch</h3><form method=POST action=https://formspree.io/f/xanwyozz><div class="row gtr-50"><div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep"><input type=text name=name id=name placeholder=Name></div><div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep"><input type=email name=email id=email placeholder=Email></div><div class=col-12><textarea name=message id=message placeholder=Message rows=5></textarea></div><div class=col-12><ul class=actions><li><input type=submit class="button alt" value="Send Message"></ul></div></div></form></section></div></div><ul class=icons><li><a href=https://twitter.com/ejpw class="icon brands fa-twitter"><span class=label>Twitter</span></a><li><a href=# class="icon brands fa-facebook-f"><span class=label>Facebook</span></a><li><a href=https://github.com/evanjpw/ class="icon brands fa-github"><span class=label>GitHub</span></a><li><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/evan-williams-1512092/ class="icon brands fa-linkedin-in"><span class=label>LinkedIn</span></a><li><a href=https://creativecommons.org/ class="icon brands fa-creative-commons"><span class=label>Creative Commons</span></a></ul><div class=copyright><ul class=menu><li>© Untitled.
